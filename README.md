# Case Finder

This project uses OpenAI models to generate clarification questions for a new ML/AI use case in two ways:

1. from the new use-case text alone; and
2. from that text plus genuinely relevant cases retrieved from the training collection.

The second path summarizes and embeds the input, retrieves five nearest summaries, asks an LLM to remove false positives, and then supplies the complete text of the remaining cases to the question-generation prompt. The notebooks display both question lists separately so they can be evaluated later.

## Project layout

- `prepare-train-data.ipynb` builds the searchable training index.
- `find-case.ipynb` retrieves related cases and generates both question lists.
- `prompts.py` contains every LLM prompt in English and is shared by both notebooks.
- `data/train/files/` contains the training cases as Markdown files.
- `data/train/train_index.csv` is generated locally and contains `id`, `summary`, and `embedding` columns.

## Setup

Python 3.10 or newer is recommended.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You may also change the LLM model, embedding model, and retrieval candidate count there. Keep the same embedding model when building and querying an index; rebuilding the index is required after changing it. OpenAI API usage may incur charges.

Start Jupyter from the repository root so the relative data paths resolve correctly:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Build the training index

Open `prepare-train-data.ipynb` and run all cells. For every Markdown file under `data/train/files`, the notebook:

1. creates a one-paragraph summary with `OPENAI_LLM_MODEL`;
2. embeds that summary with `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`; and
3. writes `data/train/train_index.csv` with the columns `id`, `summary`, and `embedding`.

The embedding is stored as a JSON array inside the CSV. The notebook saves after every processed case and resumes from existing rows, so rerunning it does not repeat successful API requests. Set `REBUILD_INDEX = True` in the configuration cell to regenerate every row (for example, after changing a prompt or model).

## Find cases and generate questions

First build the index. Then open `find-case.ipynb`, replace `USE_CASE_TEXT` in the input cell, and run all cells. The notebook will:

1. generate baseline clarification questions using only the input;
2. summarize and embed the input using the same shared prompt and configured models as indexing;
3. calculate cosine similarity and select the top five candidates;
4. have the LLM retain only semantically relevant candidates based on their summaries; and
5. generate enriched clarification questions from the target plus the complete text of retained cases.

The retrieval table, LLM relevance decisions, baseline questions, and enriched questions remain available as notebook variables for inspection. If no candidate passes relevance filtering, the enriched stage still runs with an explicit statement that no relevant reference was found.

## Notes

- Run notebooks only from the repository root, or update the path constants in their configuration cells.
- Do not commit `.env` or the generated index; both are ignored by Git.
- Case text is sent to the configured OpenAI API. Review your organization's privacy and data-handling requirements before using sensitive material.
