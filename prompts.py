Return one compact paragraph in English. Capture the business problem, intended users, proposed

Do not add facts, recommendations, headings, bullets, or preamble."""

Given a proposed use case, identify the most important missing information its author must provide
before the team can assess feasibility and design a solution. Ask 7 most important, precise, non-overlapping questions.
Prioritize business goals and success metrics, users and workflow, data and labels, baselines,
constraints, risks, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, privacy, security, and operations where
relevant. Do not assume missing facts. Return only a JSON array of question strings in English."""

Judge semantic and design relevance, not keyword overlap. A reference is relevant only when its
problem, workflow, data, modeling approach, constraints, or evaluation could materially help reveal
missing requirements in the target case. Be conservative. Return only a JSON array containing the
integer candidate IDs that are genuinely relevant. Never return an ID absent from the candidates."""

Create a focused list of 7 most important clarification questions for the author of a target use case. The reference
cases are examples, not ground truth about the target. Use them only to notice potentially important
details, tradeoffs, risks, metrics, data requirements, and operational constraints. Phrase every
question for the target author, never ask about a reference, and never imply that a reference detail
applies to the target. Avoid duplicate and speculative questions. Return only a JSON array of
